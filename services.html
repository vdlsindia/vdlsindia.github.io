				<h2>Implementation</h2>
				<p>Working in continual partnership both with our existing and with our new clients, VDLS INDIA coordinate all implementations to very exacting and clearly defined standards. Whether these implementations are for new customer systems, for conversions from one operating and support platform to another or for the additions of new modules or upgrades to existing banking platforms, a stringent set of controls and protocols is followed to assure that everything runs smoothly and worry-free.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="child">
				<h2>Training</h2>
				<p>The keystone of all new implementations is the training of the operating staff to handle adequately the flow and processing of data under the new systems platform. VDLS India has a truly excellent and very seasoned training team in-house to accommodate all training needs and to provide your operating and support personnel with the comfort level required for continuity and top-notch customer service.</p>
				<p>For platform conversions, training takes place pre-conversion (classroom prototype sessions), during conversion (on-site and ad hoc) and post-conversion (per email, telephone or one-on-one) as required. If written training manuals for specific software modules do not already exist, they are compiled and published as required.</p>
