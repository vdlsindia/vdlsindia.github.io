<p>What is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)?</p>
<p>At its core, an ERP is an application that automates business processes, and provides insights and internal controls, drawing on a central database that collects inputs from departments including accounting, manufacturing, supply chain management, sales, marketing and human resources (HR).</p>
<p>Once information is compiled in that central database, leaders gain cross-departmental visibility that empowers them to analyze various scenarios, discover process improvements and generate major efficiency gains. That translates to cost savings and better productivity as people spend less time digging for needed data.</p>
<p>ERP software that’s tailored to meet the needs of an individual business pays major dividends, making these systems a critical tool for companies across industries and of all sizes. Many of the world’s best-known and most successful firms have leaned on ERP for the last quarter century. Now, this software can be configured and priced to meet the needs of all-size businesses.</p>
<p>Put simply, an ERP system helps unify people, core business processes and technology across an organization.</p>

<p>Why ERP Consulting ?</p>
<p>Organizations are often times challenged with certain restrictions that keep them from moving forward, such as the manual work, duplication of processes with disparate systems, the inability to support a mobile workforce, scrambling to keep track of resources, departments within the organization working in silos, and so forth. Implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system delivers key benefits to assist in overcoming these obstacles. However, as ERP systems are extensive business management tools, sometimes they can be difficult to implement or understand. That’s where ERP consulting firms come in handy, and that’s why we’ve provided you with the top ERP consulting firms to consider for your next ERP project.</p>
